TsuDB
=====

Program to read in, process, analyze, and plot data from a tsunami deposit database.

The database is derived from field studies of tsunami deposit characteristics and 
tsunami hydrodynamics. The original data comes from a variety of studies from 1998 to 
2011 and is mainly stored in excel and text files. This project originated as an
effort to bring the data into a single program where many tsunamis could be 
studied side by side. TsuDB now comprises an extended set of tools for processing,
analyzing, and visualizing the data in the tsunami deposit database.

*Note that many unittest tests will fail without the proper test data files. These files
contain real data and have been excluded from the public GitHub page.
